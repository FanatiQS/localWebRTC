This is a bare bones demonstration of how to create a WebRTC connection without any kind of server involved what so ever. Instead of using a server, you connect the clients manually to make it easier to understand what is actually going on. Currently I have only successfully tested this with two chrome windows on different machines on the same local network. Firefox does not work right now and throws errors. I have not yet bothered testing any other browser. Feel free to test and submit your results.

This is a modified version of the code in this thread on stackoverflow
