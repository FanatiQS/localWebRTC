This is a bare bones demonstration of how to create a WebRTC connection without any kind of server involved what so ever. Instread, you connect the clients manually to make it easier to understand what is actually going on. Currently I have only successfully tested this with two chrome windows on my local machine and I have tested it with two machines on the same network. Firefox does not work right now and throws errors. I have not tested any other browser.
