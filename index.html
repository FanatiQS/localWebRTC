	<p>Get two chrome clients and open this file on both of them. Let's call the first one A and the second one B. Go to the console on both of them and run some commands.</p>

	<p>On both clients, create a new RTC instance with "var rtc = new RTC();". Then, in client A, run "rtc.init();"</p>

	<p>Copy the spd printed in the console and go to client B. There, paste the sdp in the textbox and make sure it ends with a newline.</p>

	<p>Then run "rtc.connect(textbox.value)". Copy the new sdp you got back and go back to client A again. Paste the new sdp in the textbox here and again make sure it ends with a newline. Then run the command "rtc.answer(textbox.value)".</p>

	<p>Now the connection is established and you can use the "rtc.send(string)" to send messages that will end up in the console on the other client.</p>
